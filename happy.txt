This project has been exceedingly difficult.  I have not found anyone to help me
so far.  A few have stepped forward, but to date there has not been one line of
source code that has been contributed by another soul.

Even with all of this upon my shoulders, I have such amazing peace in my heart.
I have a sense of the long distance runner in the middle of the race, settled in
for the long haul, having gotten my second wind.

I am thankful unto my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, for bringing me this far.
There has been nothing about this project that has been easy, but there when I
have felt week, or troubled, my Lord has always been there and I have come through
in faith, in seeking a closer relationship with Him.  And, that being far more
important than anything I could hope to complete on this project, I consider it
already to be an outstanding success.

May the Lord bless you richly in your pursuit of Him with everything in your life.
I pray that He will continually grow your efforts in serving Him, and reaching
others, throughout the remainder of your days, until He calls you Home.  Amen.

Happiness.  Joy.  Amazing Love.  The Lord's domain.

Best regards,
Rick C. Hodgin
