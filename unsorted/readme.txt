== DebiX86Disassembler ==

This project works with CodeLite by Eran Ifrah.  I have not worked on
it in a few years, but so far as I remember it works correctly on
disassemblying protected mode executable opcodes, as reasonably well
on real-mode executable opcodes.  It does not have 64-bit support,
nor many of the newer ISA extensions related to later SSE iterations,
or other extensions.

This represents a lot of work I did with my evenings while staying in
a hotel room in downtown Lawrenceville, IL, circa 2009 - 2010. :-)

Best regards,
Rick C. Hodgin
