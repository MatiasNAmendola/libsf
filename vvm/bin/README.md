VVM
====
        Visual FreePro Virtual Machine, independent and capable of
        being used for non-VFrP applications.
		
		For English:
		  (1) vvm.exe
		  (2) vdebug.exe
		
		For Spanish:
		  (1) vvm -r:es
		  (2) vdebug

        As of October 28, 2012, the only functionality that exists is
        a primitive ability to create screens from a main launcher
        screen which responds correctly to keystrokes.  It may seem
        minor, but it does include all required functionality to
        behave as a proper debugger and, more specifically, a VVMOSS-
        supported application.
        
        As of November 7, 2012, the functionality internally has been
        improved significantly.  Outwardly the main debugger launch
        screen will appear duplicated four times, with the text
        "Hi, mom!" appearing in black on white overwriting part of
        the normal vdebug launcher screen, along with the exit button,
		a 24-bit bitmap loaded from disk at the explicit path that
		likely won't be present in your testing.  Do not fear. :-)
        
        May The Lord Jesus Christ bless the work of my hands as I offer
        up the best of my abilities unto man.

                             in VASM and VVMMC.
