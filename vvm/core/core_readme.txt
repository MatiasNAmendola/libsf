===========
The current directory structure will soon be replaced with these names:

Current						Future
--------------------		--------------------

	localization\		=>	localization\
	plugins\			=>	plugins\
	vasm\				=>	vasm\
	vdebug\				=>	vdeb\
	vvm\				=>	vvm\
	vvmmc\				=>	mc\
	vvmoss\				=>	oss\
	vvmtests\			=>	tests\

Two new projects will also be added:

						=>	rdc\
						=>	developer\

RDC is the Rapid Development Compiler framework that will be used for the edit-and-continue
compiler, which will integrate with the IDE, called Developer.

Still some more testing to do on processing events through regions and callbacks, rendering
canvases, child canvases, screens, etc.  It is not a small task by any means, but things are
progressing very nicely for a one-man-show. :-)

All of these plans are subject to the Lord, and James 4:15.  May His will be done in my life.
May the work of my hands be a blessing unto those who receive it, and pleasing in the sight
of my God and Savior, Jesus Christ.  Amen.

Best regards,
Rick C. Hodgin
