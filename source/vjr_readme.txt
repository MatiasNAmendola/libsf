===========
This project has not received any further development since its initial push.
The reason is I have heard from many sources that they do not want a scaled
down version of Visual FreePro, but rather they want the full version.  As
such, it is likely this project will never see any further development.

However, once the algorithms in the full version of Visual FreePro are debugged,
it might be worth returning to this version and creating a lightweight version
for quick-and-dirty apps that don't need much power, but just need to display
forms, edit and process data, and that in a very lightweight footprint.

It is estimated that VJr would only be 4 MB in size max for the full developer
version with basic forms/classes/reports IDE, and runtime.
