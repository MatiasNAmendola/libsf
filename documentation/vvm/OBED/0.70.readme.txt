===========
The current draft revision of OBED is 0.70.  This draft is still in flux,
so check back often.  However, development is proceeding in the VVMMC
(Visual FreePro Virtual Machine (VVM) Machine Code (MC)) module, as well
as in VASM (the Visual FreePro Assembler), and VDeb (the Visual FreePro
Debugger).

See:
\libsf\vvm\core\vvm.sln
\libsf\vvm\core\vvmmc\
\libsf\vvm\core\vasm\
\libsf\vvm\core\vdebug\

Blessings! :-)

Best regards,
Rick C. Hodgin
