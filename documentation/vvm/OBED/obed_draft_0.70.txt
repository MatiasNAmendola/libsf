Object/Event Driven Virtual Machine (OBED)
------------------------------------------

The machine boots up with a memory buffer beginning at offset 0.  Instantiates with a single
program object, which points to an initial environment.  This program was previously compiled
for operation on the OBED VM.  It is a BXML file that contains specific information for loading
into the OBED VM.


VARIABLE DEFINITIONS
--------------------
All OBED variables names are prefixed during compilation with a four-character sequence
identifying their type and locality.  These do not affect their relationship to outside-
facing variable names, but are used internally for processing.

The format conveys two parts, XYYY.

EXAMPLE:  p,l,g,t,v,r		-- Parameter, Local, Global, Thread global, Private, Return
          s08,s16,s32,s64	-- Signed 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit
          u08,u16,u32,u64	-- Unsigned 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit
          f32,f64			-- Floating point, 32-bit, 64-bit
		  bni				-- Bignum integer
		  bnf				-- Bignum floating point

NOTE:  These are defined in the code executed on the VM.  The debugger environment has
       settings which allow this naming convention to be hidden, 
       An example of a simplified variable name:
	   
              OBED VM sees:     ls64Foo
			
              In the debugger:  foo
			               Or:  lnFoo

						   
Global Objects Visible in the Debugger
--------------------------------------
	The object structure is given by the natural hierarchy which is visible in the VVM structs.  Refer to the vvm_structs.png
	image for the relationship between structs.
// TODO:  Create this vvm_structs.png image once the structures settle down. :-)


Relative Pathnames
------------------
The VVM creates an isolated virtual environment, and supports a
home folder location that can always be identified within a pathname
as "//" followed by the relative portion.  This makes "//" its "root"
directory.  In this way, migrating suspended VVM instances from one
machine to another, or one session to another, allows their data
connections to persist, even if suspended and resumed later.


Dynamic Snippets
----------------
Dynamic Snippets exist as two distinct types.  One is for external definition.
The other is for support of edit-and-continue.

(1) The first is something most developers will be familiar with.
It specifies the interface parameters in communicating with an
external DLL.  It is the prototype definition that is created in
the VVM, so that the VVM calls the appropriate dynamic snippet,
which then forwards on to the external DLL.  And, upon return,
based upon the return parameter(s), it translates information
from the DLL into VVM-specific variables.

(2) The VVM supports an edit-and-continue ABI, and this is how it
is implemented.  Initially (at the time of first compile), an
actual snippet is created.  However, if that snippet is replaced
in the debugger during runtime, a dynamic snippet takes its place.
A "forward pointer" from the snippet indicates which dynamic
snippet should be run in its place.  And with each subsequent
change either the dynamic snippet is updated (depending on the
nature of the change), or it is supplanted by a new dynamic
snippet with the previous one being moved into an anchor history
list if required.


Datum
------
	A Datum is the lowest-level primitive form for storing data.
	It is the root item used on every object, as each object
	reference has a name and associated data.  Both the name and
	the data are stored as Datums.  Every data has a name, and
	name length, and a data, and data length.  There is also a
	Datum2 which allows a "logical size" to be created, which
	is not allocated, but indicates a maximum that can be allocated.

	
Object
------
	Every variable is an object.
	Every object is a container.
	Every object has a next and prev to siblings.
	Every object has a parent and child for lineage.

	
Memory
------
	All memory is linear per program.  No paging.  No mechanical swapping to disk.  So far as the VVM programs
	are concerned, there is an unlimited 64-bit flat memory area which extends from 0 upward.
	
	Memory is initially allocated beginning at offset 0 for some size (a VVM instance setting, minimum of 4MB).
	The VVM can launch paused with no program running.  From there, prior saved sessions can be restored, or
	programs can be loaded manually and run.
	
	Each program has a main, and it begins running at that location.  Every suspended and resumed process will
	maintain its last executing line, and will continue on from there upon resumption.  Only those functions
	which are not tagged (|NOSUSPEND|) can be suspended in.

	Various fixed internal objects are maintained outside of the main memory area of the VVM.  Facilities are
	provided to allow those external features to allocate memory in a special area that is reserved by the
	VVM for saving and restoring across sessions.

	Every object has members which are accessed through a VVM API.  This allows the VVM to maintain additional
	necessary items which are used for speedups, or other purposes, yet without influencing the nature of the
	object.


Edit-and-continue
-----------------
	The VVM also allows the code stream to be intermixed with non-VVM code running on the native CPU.  As of
	the 0.70 draft revision, plans are for x86 and ARM support.  The integrated compiler allows for edit-and-
	continue on all supported CPU architectures.  Anything that exists outside of the snippet nature of the
	VVM, x86, or ARM, can only be viewed in disassembly mode, and edited by changing opcodes as through the
	assembler.  These changes, at present, cannot persist beyond current execution.

	All VVM, x86, and ARM snippets, and any corresponding dynamic snippets, support full edit-and-continue.
	Every line of code can be edited and changes applied on a running VVM instance.  Any thread currently
	executing code in a snippet being updated will be suspended, the change applied, and if the source line
	in operation will not be affected by the change, continued, otherwise the thread will be suspended so a
	developer can determine through the debugger on which line to proceed.
	

VVM Registers
------------------------------------------
	All registers are accessed via offset within the register space.  There are no fixed locations which
	represent certain types of registers.  However, there are logical forms which are used in the VVM
	assembly language, which relate to common locations.  However, any offset can be used as input for
	any instruction.
	
	The result from every operation is always stored at offset 0 in register space, typically clobbering
	up to the first 64-bits, or 8-bytes.

	OFFSET		CODE	INTEGER REGISTERS
	------		----	-----------------
	+000		n/a		RESULT						; All computed results are returned here
	+008		n/a		BUMP RESULT					; A common location used with BUMP to store a previous result

	
	Note:  The following are shorthand names to explicit offsets, which can make reading assembly easier.
	
	OFFSET		INTEGER Register Alias Names
	------		----------------------------
	; 264 bytes is full register space
	; Begins at 0 and continues up to 255 plus the extra 8-bytes beyond (ending at 263)

	; These are common names assigned to various areas
	; The ability to emulate the x86 ISA, and ARM ISA, indicates some registers alias
